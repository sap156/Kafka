# trial period.
confluent.license=
# A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to
# the Kafka cluster used for licensing. All servers in the cluster will be
# discovered from the initial connection, so it is not necessary to specify the
# full set of servers here (although it may be desirable to specify more than
# one anyway in the event that one of the servers is down).
confluent.bootstrap.servers=kafka:9092
# The replication factor for the Kafka topic used for Confluent Platform
# configuration, including licensing information. This is only used if the topic
# does not already exist, and the default of 3 is appropriate for production
# uses. If you are using a development environment with fewer than 3 brokers,
# you must set this to the number of brokers (often 1).
